You'll also find me on [discord](https://discord.com/users/890701039735558164), [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/0x5.uk), [twitter/x](https://www.twitter.com/tim_abell), [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@tim_abell), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/timabell/), various slacks, and very occasionally facebook (shudder).

You should too.
