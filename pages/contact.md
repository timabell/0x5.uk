What about **WhatsApp** you ask? I mean *everyone* is on there, right? Well I uninstalled Whatsapp and deleted the account after [facebook bought whatsapp](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/10/06/facebook-closes-19-billion-whatsapp-deal/) and now [slurps up whatsapp data](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/). You should too as they have shown they can't be trusted with your data through [facebook localhost collection backdoors](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/03/meta_pauses_android_tracking_tech/), [facebook collection of phone call logs](https://mashable.com/article/facebook-android-phone-call-data-gathering), and [facebook slurping up whatsapp data](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37485589). Oh and that "end-to-end encryption" they tout on WhatsApp, don't you think they might have a switch somewhere the authorities can use to make them turn it off for "persons of interest"? I have no evidence, but the incentives make it highly likely, and of course they would have a gag so they could never reveal it otherwise it would ruin [the whole game](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163389/joseph-cox-dark-wire-fbi-phone-startup-anom-criminals-secure-messaging-decoder-interview). I did try having a burner phone with whatsapp on it, but then everyone can see my number has a WhatsApp account and incorrectly assumes I'll read it, so that didn't work.
