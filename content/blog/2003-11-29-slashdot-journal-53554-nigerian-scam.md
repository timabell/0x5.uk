<p>Edit: Apparently indiatimes is genuine. (sorry! India Times) must've been just a webmail account. Couldn't see half the site from home. Oh well. Maybe this isn't so exciting then. -4/12/03<br>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Thought I'd do some detective work today.<br>This is a bit of an obtuse one, but here goes anyway.</p>
<p>I received a copy of the negeria scam via email (Appendix 1).</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<p>source IP address: 192.116.66.219<br>spam sourced using a <a href="http://www.nyc.com/">http://www.nyc.com/</a> mail account<br>reply address 1: vinobi2000@go.com<br>reply address 2: applefamily@indiatimes.com</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>Interesting trace, the source IP Address is owned by SKY2Net ltd. (GILAT-SATCOM-BLOCK-31-32-40-46)<br>Are the spammers using satellite technology to avoid being tracked down?</p>
<p>I had a look at nyc.com and it appears to have a valid web-mail service<br><a href="https://nyc-mail.nyc.com/cgi-bin/signup/signup.pl">https://nyc-mail.nyc.com/cgi-bin/signup/signup.pl</a><br>Think I sent them a mail to their abuse section.</p>
<p>Go.com is valid and provides a web based email service which can be gained online<br><a href="https://register.go.com/go/register">https://register.go.com/go/register</a></p>
<p>I looked at <a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/">http://www.indiatimes.com/</a><br>There's a reasonably convincing first page (plenty of adverts - if we can't be conned then I suppose a bit of advertising kick-back will do!), however you can't get many other pages and the "site" quickly looks flaky. I reckon this was set up by the spammers to convince people the address was valid.<br>The site seems to exists on multiple IP addresses. See: <a href="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph?site=www.indiatimes.com">http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph?site=www.indiatimes.com</a> where all the IP addresses seem to be listed. Which address you get changes regularly (minutes apart) - see Appendix 6<br>Appendix 3 contains one of the traces, which finishes with an unreachable domain name. Very odd.</p>
<p>looking up the MX records reveals the mail server to be smtp.indiatimes.com (Appendix 4)</p>
<p>smtp.indiatimes.com (203.199.93.5) seems to work but is hosted somewhere else,  couldn't get any useful info out of tracert or ripe.net. (Appendices 2 and 5)</p>
<p>Conclusions?<br>None<br>I hate people who exploit other people. Through whatever means &amp; medium.</p>

<p>VERY URGENT AND STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>PLEASE I WANT YOU TO RELPY ME THIS MAIL TO MY ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ADDRESSES<br>vinobi2000@go.com and applefamily@indiatimes.com</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am MR. MOHAMMED ABACHA the son of the late Gen. Sani Abacha, former head<br>of State of Nigeria who died on 8th June 1998 while in office. Since the<br>death of my father the present Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has<br>been tormenting members of the Abachas family including family friends.<br>All businesses and property owned by the Abachas have been confiscated by<br>the Government and all our Bank Account in Nigeria and abroad have been<br>frozen. A quick reference of Newsweek publication of March 13th 1999 were<br>88million dollars was taken from us will give you an insight of what I<br>have gone through. After a short while I was arrested and detained in<br>prison custody,  the government came up with a trump up charge against me<br>and honestly speaking I have been in detention since November 1999 and I<br>was only released on Thursdays (11-07-02) by the supreme court of Nigeria<br>who passed judgment in my favor.</p>
<p>During the reign of my father as the president of this country, an<br>Aluminum Smelter Company of Nigeria (Alscom) contract was revealed. The<br>contract was for the construction of plant, at Ikuta Abasi in Akwa Ibom<br>State of Nigeria, for production of ingots and billets required as raw<br>material for Aluminum and Allied Industries, Reynolds Incorporated of<br>America, Phoenix and M&amp;F Companies of Switzerland conducted the<br>feasibility studies. The contract was awarded to Ferrostall AG of Germany.<br>However, after the revaluation of the contract, Ferrostall AG collected<br>its own share of the increment in project cost, while my father's share of<br>fifty-eight Million U.S. Dollars (US$58,000,000:00) was deposited on my<br>name with a security company here in Nigeria for safety keep and I know<br>that my father was planning of how to send this money abroad before his<br>sudden death in June 8 1998. Since then the money has been with the<br>security company up till date. This US$58M was secretly packaged in a<br>trunk box and the certificate of deposit where on my name and is still in<br>my possession.</p>
<p>Hence all plane is to ship this money abroad through a diplomatic means<br>without the knowledge of anybody from outside knowing my involvement in<br>this money, to avoid be seized due to my presently situation and also I am<br>handicapped as what next to do since I am not conversant with<br>international monitory policies. Hence I am contacting you as a reputable<br>and trustworthy person, with a well experience and able hand to help. This<br>was to bit the security system in Nigeria Because I want you to claim the<br>money on my behalf. I have declared to the security company that the<br>consignment belongs to (YOU) as my foreign business partners.  Actually I<br>got your contact from a reliable source, and also I believe you are in a<br>good position to assist me to transfer this fund for good investment.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of your willingness to assist me claim this money I will then<br>contact my personal attorney to draft a power of attorney that will<br>authorize you as the beneficially of this money so that you can handle<br>this transaction on my behalf. And as soon as this money leaves Nigeria I<br>will travel out to seek asylum either in Europe or America. My contract<br>with APEX FINANCE AND SECURITIES GROUP remains few weeks to expire and I<br>am down broke to renew the duration with the Security Company.</p>
<p>As a matter of urgency, I will like you to send to me immediately your<br>telephone and fax number. I shall send you all the clearance documents by<br>fax. I will then forward your name as the beneficiary and my foreign<br>business partner to the Security Company. You will be entitled to 20% of<br>the total sum involved for your assistance, 5% will be set aside for<br>reimbursement to you for any incidental expenses that may be incurred in<br>the course of the transaction. Your URGENT response is needed. I want you<br>to call my Attorney Mr. Lawrence Daniel on 234 1 7765468 for more detailed<br>directives information and the nest required step of how we have to make<br>move immediately as i have told him about you and he is to handle all the<br>processing with you on my behalf.  All your REPLY must go through these<br>our family private email address: vinobi2000@go.com and<br>applefamily@indiatimes.com , I will also need your private and direct<br>telephone and fax number for easy reach.</p>
<p>Please this is a very confidential matter, you don't disclose to anybody<br>for us to have success.</p>
<p>Best regard</p>
<p>MR MOHAMMED ABACHA</p>
