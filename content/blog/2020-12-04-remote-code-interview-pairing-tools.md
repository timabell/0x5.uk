Things that you could use to do simple coding exercises in the new world of remote everything.

* [CodeInterview.io](https://codeinterview.io/) - $5/interview or $55/month
* [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)
* [Cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/creator/home) - free for non-commercial, set your own price for commercial!
* [VSCode live share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) works well, it can do voice as well.
* Zoom/hangouts/meet/skype etc. built-in screen sharing and whatever coding setup they already use.

Thanks to my friends at eSynergySolutions for the suggestions, recorded here because the internet has a better memory than me.
