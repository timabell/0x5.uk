Update 11th Sep 2007:  
xsession responded to my support request, and the [opml](http://www.timwise.co.uk/blogroll.opml) file is now served, complete with the correct mime type.

Update 26th Dec 2009  
Now on a linux host so no mime type issues now.  

Podcast list added: [podcasts.opml](http://www.timwise.co.uk/podcasts.opml).  

Now styled with custom xslt file [opml.xsl](http://www.timwise.co.uk/opml.xsl).

As people may want to see my rss and podcast subscriptions, I have created a blogroll for you.  

I've started with an [OPML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML) file, created by hand and uploaded to my web host. Unfortunately my web host won't (currently) serve the ".opml" file extension so I've had to use .txt.  

so [http://www.timwise.co.uk/blogroll.opml](http://www.timwise.co.uk/blogroll.opml) became [http://www.timwise.co.uk/blogroll.opml.txt](http://www.timwise.co.uk/blogroll.opml.txt)  

I then validated the file with [http://validator.opml.org/](http://validator.opml.org/)  
I then added my feed to [http://share.opml.org/](http://share.opml.org/) so you can now see the list at [http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/?user_id=7189](http://share.opml.org/viewsharedfeeds/?user_id=7189)  
In the opml I've separated podcasts and news feeds, but share.opml doesn't use this info.  

There is some [controversy](http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/semanticweb/OpmlTheXmlFormatWithNoFriends) over opml, but hell, it does the job. We can all upgrade when a better alternative goes mainstream.
