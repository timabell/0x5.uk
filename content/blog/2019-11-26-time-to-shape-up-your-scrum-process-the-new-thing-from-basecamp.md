title = "Time to \"Shape Up\" your SCRUM processes? The new thing from Basecamp"
+++

Basecamp, who are famous for carving out their own path in the software world
have documented and shared their own way of defining and building their
software-as-a-serice (SaaS) product, also known as "basecamp". You can read the
whole thing here: <https://basecamp.com/shapeup>.

If like me you've mostly worked with SCRUM/Agile/Kanban style teams you should
pay attention to the ideas they share. Unlike many people who teach and follow
the wikipedia truth of SCRUM as *the* way of building software, basecamp have
not satisfied themselves with cargo-culting "industry best practice" and have
instead carefully honed their own particular way of getting the best out of
their resources.

Although the "ShapeUp" process is finely tuned to suit basecamp, there are many
things in there that the average SCRUM team could take inspiration and
improvement from without throwing out everything in place at the moment. An
example I particularly like is the way everyone can bring a pitch to the
betting table, from their own personal backlog of priorities, contrasted with
the usual approach of throwing yet another another card/story onto the
team-shared dumpster-fire of a backlog / todo-list and hoping it somehow
magically gets to the top of the list just before all your chickens come home
to roost.

# Key features of shaping up

## Shaping

* An iterative process of taking concepts from initial idea to something that
  could be built with bounded risk and expectations.
* A largely solo or pair exercise, but done in consultation with experts on the
  wider team.

## Pitch

* The output of shaping.
* A detailed but high-level document outlining what should and shouldn't be
  built, with room for discretion and design work by the designers and
  programmers.

## Bets

* There is a meeting where pitches are discussed, prioritised and scheduled for
  the next cycle of work, they "take a bet" on a pitch.
* If a pitch blows its timebox, then the default is always to stop and it
  doesn't get any special priority in the next cycle. This limits the risk of
  runaway unstoppable projects.

## 6-week cycle with gaps

Basecamp operate a 6-week period of building what was decided in shaping and
betting. This can either be one 6 week bet or set of 2 week bets.

Once this is done there is a 2-week gap where people can do maintenance, tech
debt paydown, plan new things etc.

<https://pod.timwise.co.uk/5> where I go over their process in a bit more
detail with regular co-host David.

I've also written up a nice approach to avoiding a "backlog of doom" in my
[personal backlogs post](/2020/06/30/personal-backlogs/).
