todo: make less test-specific and expand on the art of persuasion (explain why it matters to them in their terms not engineer terms)

### Programmer Excuses

#### "I don't have time"

The client/boss is paying for your time, and the boss/client would like the long term benefits, mkay?

#### "The boss/client/manager won't let me"

The "should I do a good job" question, as I like to call it.

> "Which is quicker? Do that one."  
> ~ Your client / boss

I often see all but the most experienced software engineers falling into the trap of confusing authority with expertise.

I often hear engineers complaining that "they aren't given the time" to write tests, or do a proper job on some aspect of the software they are writing.

In reality what has always happened is the engineer has presented two options to a client/employer who doesn't know or care about how software is built:

1. I can do this feature properly with all the tests and great architecture etc etc (client glazes over) it'll be amazing, or
2. I can just do the feature without any of that proper stuff. Which one do you want?

The client / boss / project manager responds [whilst thinking "I have no idea what you are talking about, or why you are asking] "Which is quicker? Do that one."

Then the engineer gets the hump that they can't do a good job.

Or worse, the engineer assumed the answer for them without even asking.

Put it this way, if a plumber came to a house, should they ask the homeowner whether to earth the pipes, or should they just do it as part of the cost of the job. The homeowner might not understand why that's part of the job, but they probably also don't want to be electrocuted by the radiator.

It is perfectly reasonable for an experienced software engineer, who is the expert in _their_ trade, to just include automated regression tests as part of the job of feature delivery. To **not even bring it up in conversation**. The client/employer NEVER wants to pay for a feature, think its done, only to have it break again four features later. From their point of view, and quite rightly, that's just shoddy software.

This is not to say I'm secretive - I work in the open and am open to people asking why things are done the way they they are, and am happy to explain to the client why it's in their best interest. But whether it happens is not up for discussion.
