[pidgin](http://pidgin.im/ "http://pidgin.im/") is quite a good irc client.

Once you have downloaded and installed pidgin:

*   Accounts > Manage Accounts
*   Add...
*   Protocol: IRC
*   Username: your preferred nickname (please use your real name)
*   Server: your irc server, eg irc.freenode.org
*   Password - leave blank
*   Add
*   Close (the "Accounts" window)

Back in the main pidgin window:

*   Buddies > Join A Chat...
*   Account: the one you just created
*   Channel: #favouriteroom, eg #pidgin  

*   Password - leave blank
*   Join

In the new chat window for the chatroom:

*   Conversation > Add...
*   Tick "Autojoin when account connects."
*   Tick "Remain in chat after window is closed."
*   Leave everything else as defaults
*   Add

Now when pidgin launches you will have "#favouriteroom" in your buddy list, and you can double click to open the chatroom.

You may also want to make pidgin start when windows starts;

From the main window:

*   Tools > Plugins
*   Tick "Windows Pidgin Options"
*   Configure Plugin
*   Tick "Start Pidgin on Windows startup"
*   Close
*   Close (plugin window)

I also recommend enabling the Markerline plugin to help see what is new in the channel.
