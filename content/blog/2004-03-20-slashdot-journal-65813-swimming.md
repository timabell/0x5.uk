<p>Not a bad week on the excercise front. Was planning to swim all five days. Managed four, but failed on wed due to brain failure leading to lack of trunks at swimming pool (and no, I was not going to swim without them, or in my boxers as some have suggested). Got back in and went for a two and a half mile run, which was good, then Miss S came over and was person number two to grace my new sofa (not in the bed configuration I might add), number one was Mr T (a good friend of Miss C). Persons three and four were the folks, (hello folks!) Mr &amp; Mrs A during random visit for cup of  tea and curry.</p>
