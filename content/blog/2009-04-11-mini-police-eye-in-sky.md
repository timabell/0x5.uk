Just a quick note on an idea that's been bothering me.  

How about a mini semi autonomous police surveillance helicopter?  

Would cheaper than a real helicopter, but still offers many of the advantages of having an eye in the sky that can go direct to the scene without contending with traffic etc.  

Something like a electric model helicopter with 2+ blades for stability, with a petrol generator for longer run times.  

Electronics and gyros to make it naturally stable, and a gps & altimeter for auto navigation.  

Carrying a payload of normal and infrared cameras for information gathering.  

Transmitting a live video feed over long range radio, and offering long distance control, so it could be controlled centrally by an operator.  

I reckon these could be produced for a few thousand pounds each and provide excellent assistance to the force.
