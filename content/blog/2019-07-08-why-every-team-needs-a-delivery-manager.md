title: Why every team needs a Delivery Manager (DM)

I was explaining to someone the team structure I'm working in at the Department
for Education's [DfE Digital](https://dfedigital.blog.gov.uk/) and realised not
everyone has seen this structure at work and the magic it brings.

## Team structures

### GDS (government) team structure

In short the team looks something like this:

* Product Manager
* Delivery Manager
* Developer(s)
* User Researcher(s)
* Content Designer(s)
* Interaction Designer(s)

At the top of the whole thing there's a "Service Owner".

Involved from the very early stages, but a bit less in the daily grind of building technical solutions, you'll find a "Service Designer".

It's a very flat structure. It's a group of peers who all bring their own
strengths to the team, but with no hard boundaries, we all muck in with
everything now and then. I particularly like helping with user research as it
keeps me connected with the users. I'm constantly feeling guilty for not
attending enough user research!

This structure is modelled on [the structure of a team at the Government
Digital Service
](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team)(GDS)

#### Aside: Product who?

You may also not be familiar with Product Manager (I've not seen it as much in
private industry), so as an aside let me explain:

~~The Product Manager is more widely known in industry as Product Owner~~ (well
that's what I thought, actually it turns out [product owner and product manager
are not quite the
same](https://melissaperri.com/blog/2017/06/29/product-manager-vs-product-owner) and [there is depth to the product manager/owner question](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/product-manager-vs-product-owner/)).
This is someone who figures out the balance of features in a service and the
software that supports it, based on all the various constraints and inputs
(e.g. user need, security, stability, internal need). One output of this role
is prioritization of work.

### Private company team structure

The kind of structure I've more commonly see in the private sector is something like this:

* Project Manager
* Business Analyst (BA)
* SCRUM Master (in title if not in deed)
* Developer(s)
* Testers(s) / QA (Quality Assurance)

### Which is better?

I've seen good and not so good people in all of the roles, and number of roles
varies with team size.

I think the GDS-style team structure is superior when it comes to shipping
user-value as a development team.

## DM for the win

The role I want to focus on here (though they are all awesome) is Delivery
Manager as it's the most uncommon in my experience.

I've personally never seen delivery management called out as a specific named
role outside of my work for "Digital" teams in UK Government. I hope this role
becomes more common everywhere.

So what does a Delivery Manager actually do?

### Greasing the enterprise wheels

In any organisation beyond about 20 people the bureaucracy starts to sneak in,
layers of rules are added as a business tries to avoid repeating previous
mistakes, and as you hit enterprise scale it's positively stifling, to the
point that people issues and an inability to even open *Microsoft Word (TM) (R)
((c) 1908)* on a work computer without signing 3 forms **in blood**, become
nearly impossible. The thing is, a dev team is usually building something that
hasn't been built before, maybe as part of a **major change to how the
organisation functions**.

Web development is more than just taking your sales
brochures and putting them online, if that was all we wanted I'd give you a
copy of WordPress and find something else to build.

Sometimes you can hide the team away in a
[skunkworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works) project, but that can't
last forever and eventually the old meets the new, and suddenly the whole
project is at risk of being rejected by the legacy organisation.  The
productivity can be sucked out of a development team for good, they can end up
unable to deliver anything.

This is where a **Delivery Manager** role is golden; they deal with making sure
the organisation's goals to have this new service / system / product / software
are able to be progressed, conversations & endless meetings had, finance
obtained, hardware procured, forms filled, security audits managed sensibly,
pile-on demands defended … the list is endless. By having this role the team
can focus on building and shipping, comfortable that they won't be sidetracked
or blocked.

I still like the way the wonderful Mark 'Stanners' Stanley put it back in 2012.
I think this cuts to best thing about it:

> The delivery manager is there to remove any and all things that are hindering
> or ‘blocking’ them, so the team can deliver the product.

The approach is not new, back in the year 2000 Joel Spolsky wrote:

> Compare this to Microsoft, where things are done at the lowest level, and
> most managers act like their most important job is to run around the room,
> moving the furniture out of the way, so people can concentrate on their work.

### Running great delivery teams

You'll also find the Delivery Manager doing inward-looking work similar to the
role of "SCRUM Master". This includes setting up the right agile environment
(which may SCRUM, Kanban, or something else), tackling any dysfunction and poor
team performance that has built up, keeping in touch with all the team to make
sure they are happy and productive, running team retrospective sessions, and
sometimes hiring-and-firing to get the best team in place.

### Is it good for devs?

As a developer on an Agile team working inside a government team (not for the
first time), I am eternally grateful for all the things I *don't* have to worry
about because we have a DM. It's not that I'm not capable, I'll happily turn my
hand to the biggest problem of the day for a team at any time, but the code
won't write itself and that's what I was hired to be a pro at. Having a DM lets
me focus more creating software that actually does a job for our users, and
makes sure we can do what's needed to make great systems even if that reaches
beyond the team's original boundaries.
