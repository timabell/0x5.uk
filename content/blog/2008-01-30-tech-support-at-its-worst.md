As you may know, I'm working through a Microsoft e-learning course at the
moment. Having had a [few
problems](http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=2206580619&size=o) with the
service I've been trying to extract some common sense from their support
services. Having failed to get anything vaguely helpful I thought I'd ask them
about who they were, and I think the following response really sums up the
level of idiocy I have encountered thus far.

When asked a simple direct question about who I was communicating with, the
response is either hilarious or depressing, I'm not sure which. It would seem
that before they can tell me where they are based, they need to know what
operating system I run, what version of flash I have, what my login is etc etc.
Talk about customer disservice. The finishing touch for me is the addition of
upbeat advertising added to a response to an evidently already irritated
customer.

Here are the last two messages for your entertainment (identifiers stripped out):

It's worth noting that this is totally consistent with the level of service I
have experienced with Microsoft e-learning. As far as I can fathom, the
e-learning system has been set up on a pile of servers and then been left to
rot whilst paying customers are fobbed off by a nameless and faceless 3rd
party. It may be profitable in the short term, but this kind of behaviour may
well be the cracks in the foundations of Microsoft's empire. I for one am
certainly plotting a course for fairer pastures.
