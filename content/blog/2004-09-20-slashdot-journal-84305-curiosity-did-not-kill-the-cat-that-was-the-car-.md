<p>This is <a href="http://slashdot.org/~mcrbids">mcrbids</a>' sig, and I want to show this to all my friends who have ever said "I'm just curious about stuff".</p>
<blockquote><div><p> <i>I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.</i><br>--Albert Einstein</p></div></blockquote>
<p>I knew there was nothing magic about knowledge and talent, it's all about dedication, and there's no better motivation than curiosity.</p>
