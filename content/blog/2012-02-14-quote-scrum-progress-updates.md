Quote of the day

on 05 Jan 09 07:15:

> ... Even a one hour task might change to an eight hour task (or multiple
> tasks..) due to new information found out during that one hour that was the
> original estimate. The key point is not to focus on how many hours the team
> got done on the task, but how many hours really are remaining. The daily
> update should never be: "I worked on that for four hours, so you can take
> four hours out of the estimate", but rather a real estimate on how much work
> still needs to be done based on current knowledge.
