Here's one I made earlier (19 Oct 2006 according to my pc):  

<div class="flickr-pic">
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/7463254@N02/439217204/"><img
src="https://live.staticflickr.com/160/439217204_ddcd1306e6.jpg" alt="bourneshell.png"></a>
</div>

It's modified from [http://thebourneidentity.com/](http://thebourneidentity.com/), which is incidentally a film I very much like.  

For those who don't know, this is the bourne shell:  
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)  
Which is the father of [BASH](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (/bin/bash, the Bourne Again SHell)
