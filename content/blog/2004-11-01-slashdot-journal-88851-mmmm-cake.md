<p>I've got the first cake I've ever made in the oven right now.<nobr> </nobr>:D</p>
<p>I've been flat out with work for ages and am knackered. I still haven't managed to get all my clocks running on GMT yet. I arrived in an empty field an hour early on Sunday - doh!</p>
<p>Does anyone know of anyone looking to share a place in Reading?</p>
<p>I got a childrens book in my shreddies the other day. At first I thought bah, humbug, another irritating marketing tactic. But now I've finished the cereal, and extracted the book from the packaging and am enjoying it! I guess it's inifitely better than the biodegrade-proof waste of hydrocarbons they normally include.</p>
<p>Oooh, five mins till my cake's done.<nobr> </nobr>:)<br>It's risen...<br>I'll let you know how it tastes.</p>
<p>xx</p>
