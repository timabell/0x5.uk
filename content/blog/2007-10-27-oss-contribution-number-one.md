I've had my first ever patch to an open source project accepted! Yay! (Fanfare please... no? anyone? oh well.)  

Ok it's a one word change to a piece of documentation, but hey it's still something.  

The project is [gnucash](http://www.gnucash.org/). For details take a look at [the bug report](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=490699) I created to hold the patch. I even got a thanks :-).
