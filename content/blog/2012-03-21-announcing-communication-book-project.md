I've been working on a piece of open source software to assist people who have
[aphasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia) (speech difficulties), and it
is now sufficiently functional to be worth mentioning. It's still very rough
around the edges, but if you are on a debian based system you should be able to
easily get it up and running and see what you think. If you are on other
platforms you'll currently need a bit (alright, a lot) of java knowledge to get
this up and running.  

If you have the time to help I'd be very grateful. You don't have to be a
coder, just letting me know if it works for you would be great.  

If you want to know more or would like to give it a try then please do head
over to the project page at
