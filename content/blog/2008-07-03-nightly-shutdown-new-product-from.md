Congratulations to Joel Mansford, a good friend of mine, and his company
[Proven Works](http://www.provenworks.com/) on getting the [first
release](http://joelmansford.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/new-utility-to-shutdown-your-network-pcs-at-night/)
of [Nightly Shutdown](http://www.nightlyshutdown.com/) out of the door.

This looks to be a great product and hopefully will make system administrators'
lives easier and greener. It's a utility for ensuring that the computers are
off when you want them to be, and can be deployed through active directory
making the sys admin's life easier. There's a 10 PC free trial available, so
check it out at the [download
page](http://www.nightlyshutdown.com/DownloadRequest.aspx).

 Without even looking I know this will be a good
product and fantastically well supported. Best of luck to all at Proven Works,
and to all the potential users and buyers out there, don't forget to check it
out and provide any feedback you can.
