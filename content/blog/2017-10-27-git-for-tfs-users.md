I'm considering creating a 30 minute video to help teams transition from Team Foundation Server source control to git (hosted with TFS or Visual Studio Team Services - aka VSTS).

Please [register your interest](http://eepurl.com/c9imrH). If I get enough interest in this then I'll do the work to put it together and launch it.
