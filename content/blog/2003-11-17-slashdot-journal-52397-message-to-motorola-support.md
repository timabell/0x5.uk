<p>to: mcrc@ei.css.mot.co.uk<br>subject: support request</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>I spoke to one of your people on the phone and she recommended I mail details of the three issues I'm having with my new Motorola bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>I own a Sony Ericsson P800<br>(Firmware details: Phone: CXC162002 R2D, Bluetooth: CXC12529 R5A)</p>
<p>I have purchased (yesterday) a Motorola HS810 Bluetooth headset to use with it. (From car phone wharehouse)<br>It paired up correctly and I have successfully made &amp; received calls using it.</p>
<p>I am now having difficulty with voice dialling features. When I press the multifunction button on the side of the headset (which does work for answering calls and hanging up) in order to begin a call using voice dialling, the phone picks up the bluetooth connection, but does not then look up any voice commands as it should. I have tested this functionality without the headset and it works as follows: hold down jog dial, speak name, number is dialled.<br>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Probably a separate issue: I don't hear the recorded name that the phone plays when I receive an incoming call from a number which has a voice recording attached (the phone says "playing voice command" but the headset doesn't have sound at that point).</p>
<p>The other thing was: the manual says if you press both volume buttons then the LEDs will stop flashing. But they don't, which is odd.</p>
<p>I look forward to any help you can give me with these queries.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>Tim Abell<br>077** ******</p>
