Just bought a shared server with [bytemark](https://www.bytemark.co.uk/). (Â£10/month), Installed vanilla ubuntu 16.04LTS server using the control panel (virtually one-click).

(Love the cancel button text!)

Ssh'd in, created my own user to use with sudo instead of root. Ran the following, and immediately had a copy of sdv listening on the internet.

```
sudo apt install tmux docker docker-compose
sudo adduser tim docker
# logout & reconnect to get new group to take effect
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timabell/sdv-docker/master/docker-compose.yml
```

and then for the magic:

```
tim@sdvweb:~$ docker-compose up

And that's it, listening on the internet!

Any changes I make will be to the [docker and compose files](https://hub.docker.com/r/timabell/sdv/), resulting in trivially easy to repeat deployments, making the server completely throwaway. Huzzah! Docker is awesome.

I've also bought a domain for the product, but haven't set much up on it yet: <http://www.sqldataviewer.com/>

Next up, getting nginx reverse proxy to provide ssl. And finishing the refactor I was in the middle of to get data types to behave, and finishing the automated regression tests I'd just started (needed for reliable multi rdbms support), and finding my market, and marketing the product, and doing more features, and build the marketing automation to drive sales, etc etc. Not too much to do then! Your support would be appreciated, if you're interested make sure you [sign up to the mailing list now](https://www.getdrip.com/forms/70504364/submissions/new)!
