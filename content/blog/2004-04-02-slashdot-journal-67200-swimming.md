<p>It's been two weeks, but I was back in the pool for training this week, and I cycled there (admittedly not entirely through choice - temporary absence of car was prime motivation). Swam 0.9km in the hour and surprisingly not that tired.</p>
<p>Unrelatedly, just so you know my current desktop at work is picture of v cute &lt;1 month old kittens.</p>
<p>Never got any further with usb key thing, too much else on, and being a true programmer I'd hate to actually finish something once I've started it!</p>
<p>And J says <a href="http://www.dlink.co.uk/pages/products/DBT-900AP.asp">bluetooth for LAN</a></p>
