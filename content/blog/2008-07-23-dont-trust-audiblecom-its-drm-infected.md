If there's one thing I hate (there isn't, there's lots, but this is today's)
it's companies being economical with the truth to get you to part with your
money, only to have you disappointed when you find out the whole truth.

I just bought an audio book on audible.co.uk. And now I can't even listen to
it. I thought I was buying an mp3, or maybe even an ogg file. It is only on
actually attempting to download the thing I have just paid for that I discover
to my utter disgust that _all_ the download links are for some kind of evil drm
type program (I presume here, but there sure as hell was no mp3 in sight).

As you can see from the screenshot above, they clearly imply an mp3 download. I
haven't seen such a clear use of weasel sales words for some time.

Next time I'll read the god damn small print, but I still think this is totally
out of order not warning that they are providing crippled versions of what you
think you are buying.

Thank fsm for people like the FSF. Their logo really sums up how I feel about
being treated in this way.

## Update: credit where due. 24th July 2008

My complaint about the website still stands, and my aversion to
drm has not diminished, however the responses I have received from their
customer service (by email), have been prompt, courteous and have totally
resolved my outstanding problem. I have been given a full refund. I've been
especially impressed given the hot blooded content of my initial contact. A lot
of companies could learn lessons in good customer relations from these people.

## Update: the battle is lost (for now). 12 Aug 2019

I use audible (now an amazon company) on my not-very-freedom-loving android
phone these days. I haven't tried using audbile on a linux desktop lately,
times have changed and everything is android/iphone first now. I still consider
DRM to be a nasty form of lockin.
