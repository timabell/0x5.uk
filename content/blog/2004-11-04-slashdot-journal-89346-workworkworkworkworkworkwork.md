<p>lately I have been mostly writing this website:<br><a href="http://www.emapsite.com/streetsahead/">http://www.emapsite.com/streetsahead/</a><br>I worked all weekend and am stretched to the limit, cos tomorrow will be the 13th day of work on the trot without a break.</p>
<p>I've managed to get fedora running nicely on my main box now, up2date and add/remove took a while to get working, and they seem to have removed mozilla's built in mail client in favour of evolution (and thunderbird).<br>I look forward to becoming a hardened linux hacker. Don't suppose any of you know if subversion is as good as the promotional material says it is do you?</p>
<p>Once again, I still need to find people who are looking for a place in Reading, if you know anyone then put them in touch with me.</p>
<p>I'm quite pleased with the progress of the online <a href="http://slashdot.org/~tim_abell/friends">friends list</a>. I'd really like everyone to be part of this network. Everyone say a big hello to our new addition Chris (old friend from back in the dayz!)</p>
<p>Did I mention how much I dislike clothes washing? I've got to hang it all up now. _sigh_</p>
