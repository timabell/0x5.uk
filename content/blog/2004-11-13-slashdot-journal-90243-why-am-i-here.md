<p>From the dnrc newsletter. Say bye bye to your eyes for reading this, especially here in my "blog".</p>

<p> <i><br>Dear Dogbert,</i></p>
<p><i>Lots of people write blogs, but I've never heard of anyone who actually reads them. What's up with that?</i></p>
<p><i>Kurt</i></p>
<p><i>Dear Skirt,</i></p>
<p><i>Blogs exist to fill the important market niche of writing that is so dull that your eyes will burrow out of the back of your head to escape. People do read blogs, usually by accident, sometimes on a dare, but those readers are later mistaken for Mafia victims with what appears to be two holes in the back of their heads. On closer inspection, you might find their eyeballs clinging to the drapes directly behind them. Unless the cat gets them first.</i></p>
<p><i>Sincerely,</i></p>
<p><i>Dogbert<br></i></p>
