1. Love Jira. The main method of ensuring the team builds the right thing at the right time is a quality & well ordered backlog.
2. The team owns the stories and tickets. The tickets are just a tool for the team to manage the sheer volume of information and plans for what they want to build. If the team likes the tickets that's all that matters. Definition of ready should be defined by the team, bounce tickets that don't meet the standard.
3. Accept all approaches to engineering. You can nudge, discuss, encourage collaboration and best practice, and if anyone is way off then you should inform management, but in the end the tech lead isn't responsible for hiring and firing so work with and celebrate what you have, even if it's not how you'd do it.
4. Balance tech debt and maintenance with features sprint by sprint. Have a chore ticket every sprint for upgrades.
5. Fill in the gaps. Got a great product person then support them, if not then that's you and you need to bridge to the business.
6. Retrospectives are broken. Refocus them on what the team can improve instead of complaining about things that will never change.
7. It's all about relationships.
8. It's (also) all about sustainable & quality delivery of product increments.
9. Stay sharp, pick something to build or fix yourself that isn't on the critical path but makes life better for the team and the company and which keeps you intimately familiar with the technology.
