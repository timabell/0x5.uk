A friend asked me to write this up.  

To remove all those annoying adverts from the web as you see it:  

*   install & use [firefox](http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/firefox/)

*   install [adblock plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865) add-in

*   install [fliterset-g updater](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1136) add in

Job done. Thanks for listening.
