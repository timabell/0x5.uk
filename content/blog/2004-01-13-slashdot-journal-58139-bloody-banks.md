<p>Cahoot just managed to cost me 80 pounds, in a day.</p>
<p>==============================<br>To: service.relationship.team@cahoot.com<br>Subject: Banking error.</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>You've bounced three transactions on my current account and charged me £60 all on the 12th Jan. Despite there being a transfer to cover the whole amount made on the same day.</p>
<p>I am very annoyed and will be leaving cahoot unless this is resolved to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>Please refund the £60 to my account immediately and make arrangements to cover charges I will receive for the three failed transactions, plus a small sum to cover the expenses I will incur in dealing with BT, Egg &amp; Student Loans Co.</p>
<p>Egg will charge £20.<br>I have yet to contact BT and Student Loans Co, but doubtless sorting this out will be a problem.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>Tim Abell.</p>
<p>--------------------<br>Edit:<br>After much email ping pong they finally refunded the 60 quid they charged me. Still moving banks tho.</p>
