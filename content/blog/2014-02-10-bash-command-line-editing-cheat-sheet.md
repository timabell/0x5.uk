*   **ctrl-a/e** start/end of line
*   **alt-f/b** forward/back a word
*   **ctrl-w/alt-d** delete to start/end of word
*   **alt-.** add argument from previous command (repeat to cycle) - love this one
*   **ctrl-shift-_** undo (i.e. ctrl-underscore)
*   **ctrl-y** paste (yank) deleted text  

    *   **alt-y** paste older deleted text instead
*   prefix with **alt+digit** (0-9) to do multiple, e.g. delete two words

*   start with **alt-minus** to go backwards

Just a few notes I threw together for my own benefit. I finally got around to learning a bit more about editing commands on the Linux shell / terminal.
