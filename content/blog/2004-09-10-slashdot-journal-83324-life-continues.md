<p>Worked many hours this week, trying to get new work web site finished.</p>
<p>So this evening I cycled to the pool and did an hours training. I'm now tired and chlorinated, but very relaxed.<br>---<br>My web server went off on one at 2am the other night (just when I was thinking of going to sleep), thrashing its hdd. Think someone was trying to hack into it with a buffer overflow. Here's the log:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p> <tt>4.227.111.174 - - [09/Sep/2004:02:22:01 +0100] "POST http://4.227.111.174:25/ HTTP/1.1" 200 480 "-" "-"</tt></p></div> </blockquote>
<p>Sods.</p>
<p>Looking at my logs, the server was subject to a few attempts within hours of it coming online.<br>Much more than my hosted site. Guess it's people running <a href="http://www.insecure.org/">nmap</a> against adsl dial up ip ranges and getting all excited by the prospect of an open port 80.</p>
<p>Here's a classic example:</p>

<p>--<br>By the way, if you think nmap is very uncool to know about, may I direct you to the news article on nmap's site which shows Trinity actually doing a real hacking attack in the film Matrix Reloaded<br><a href="http://www.insecure.org/">http://www.insecure.org/</a></p>
