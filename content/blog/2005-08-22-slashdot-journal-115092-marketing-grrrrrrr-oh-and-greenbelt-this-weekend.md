<p>My mobile just rang.<br>No signal as usual so couldn't hear anything.<br>Looked up the <a href="http://www2.bt.com/localarea">area code</a>, was for Swansea. Ah, thinks me. might be tom. Tried to phone back, piece of crap phone promptly crashed. Turn it on again, swear at the "Vodafone - How are you" greeting (How am I? Pissed off cos the phone crashed, duh. That's the only time I ever see that message). Tried again, only to find it's not tom<nobr> </nobr>:( but some marketing company. Ugh. Cue registration on the <a href="http://www.tpsonline.org.uk/tps/">Telephone Preference Service</a>, and a pissy journal entry.<nobr> </nobr>:)</p>
<p>In other news, plan is to do a day trip to <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/">greenbelt</a> on the saturday. All welcome.</p>
