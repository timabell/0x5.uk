<p>I wrote a song to be played by <a href="http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/src/sing/default.asp"></a><br>this singing thing<br><i><br>be happy, don't worry.<br>feel glad, it's not that bad<br>the sun shines,<br>our friends are close to us</i></p>
<p><i>all the fear is far away<br>so be happy and be gay</i></p>
