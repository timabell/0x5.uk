# Breakdown cover maths

So, I'm getting rather fed up with the AA taking the michael every year with
their renewals. Yes, I gather the RAC are just as bad but I think they need to
realise their customers aren't stupid, know exactly what they are playing at,
and can do the maths.

I want to highlight what I think is a particularly dirty trick, making
something look like a free perk when it's anything but.

# So here's some numbers:

This is for a single car policy covering Roadside, Home Start and Relay
starting July 2012 paying annually for a year up front. (The monthly option is
10% more expensive, go figure). Numbers rounded to pounds.

*   Renewal through the post: **£135**
*   Matching [RAC cover](http://www.rac.co.uk/uk-breakdown/)(checked online &
    by phone): **£101**
*   [AA online
    price](http://www.theaa.com/breakdown-cover/uk-breakdown/view-options.do?optMshp=vcon300)
    for new customers: **£92** -(so much for 6 years loyalty, a **<span
    style="color: red;">£43</span>** kick in the teeth)
*   AA phone price: **£116**
*   AA phone price _without gold membership "benefits"_: **£89**

That means, the AA are pricing their gold benefits at **<span style="color:
red;">£27</span>** even though they look like they are free on the renewal
letter! Some cheek.

I queried the details of this so called benefit and established the following:

*   _"Accident Management"_ - means being towed by the AA after an accident
    (something you may be covered for under your car insurance policy)
*   _European Breakdown Cover_ - only useful if you are going abroad
    (obviously), did you really want to be paying for it?
*   _"Family Associates Cover for under 17s"_ - something about teenagers, I
    don't have any so not very useful to me
*   _Key Insurance_ - this could be valuable, but £27/year sounds like very
    expensive insurance to me even though they are expensive items to replace.
*   _Legal Advice_ - **Included as standard!** So not a gold benefit at all.
    Weasels.
*   _Technical Advice_ - **Included as standard!** See above. Still weasels.

So it turns out that the supposed discount of **£44.90** on the posted renewal
was actually a **<span style="color: red;">£46</span>** insult to my
intelligence.

I'm no money saving expert, but that's outrageous.
