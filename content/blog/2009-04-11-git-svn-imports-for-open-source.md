I've just written a lengthy [open letter to github](https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2009-April/025196.html) in the hope that they will support continuous centralized imports from svn to git.  

If they don't wish to rise to the challenge (and I wouldn't hold it against them), I am wondering if it would be viable to run a server on fasthosts or something funded by donations that would do nothing but continuously import from svn servers, and push the result to github.  

That's all for now.
