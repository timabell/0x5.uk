I'm not there yet so I'm no authority, but here's some things that I think are fab resources on my journey. They are helping me change my thought patterns and behaviour to make success more likely.

## Books (roughly in order of my journey)

*   [The e-myth (revisited)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81948.The_E_Myth_Revisited?ac=1&from_search=true)
*   [A better mousetrap - the business of invention](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Better-Mousetrap-business-invention/dp/0951385607)
*   [The Art of the Start](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22835624-the-art-of-the-start-2-0)
*   [Key person of influence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23353984-key-person-of-influence-revised-edition?from_search=true)
