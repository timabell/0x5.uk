<div>Thought for the day:</div>

Completed projects should **always** inlcude SQL scripts for creating working test data (i.e. so you can see the code in action).

<div>I often see difficulties creating usable test data when picking up someone else's work.</div>

<div>And I'd add to that, a readme file with how to use the test data.</div>

<div>(short blog post, but too long for a tweet!)</div>
