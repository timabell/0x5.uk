Hello dear readers,  

I've started working on a data brower for relational databases that allows you to click through ids with foreign-keys to get around.  

Take a look at [http://www.timwise.co.uk/sdv/](http://www.timwise.co.uk/sdv/) and if you think you might be interested then please do sign up to my [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/bDGPjf), and let me know if you have any feedback.  

This started as a holiday exercise in learning google's go programming language, but is intended to become a fully-fledged software product available to buy.  

Tim
