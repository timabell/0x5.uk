<p>I will soon start digitally signing my email for reasons similar to this:<br><a href="http://www.linuxmafia.com/~rick/linux-info/rant-gpg">http://www.linuxmafia.com/~rick/linux-info/rant-gpg</a><br>If it bothers you then I may send you copies of the included rant. And if you don't like it then you will lose your right to complain when someone sends email spoofed from your address<nobr> </nobr>:-)</p>
<p>If you want a good alarm clock / hifi I can recommend my latest <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=5746472812&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT">eBay listing</a>.</p>
