<p>I've been looking for a show to listen to for some time that has some decent music in it. Finally I've found one:<br>The podshow music rewind: <a href="http://rewind.podshow.com/">http://rewind.podshow.com/</a><br>Check it out. This guy plays clips from all the podshows, showcasing the best new music from the podsafe music network.</p>
<p>I came across it thanks to Adam Curry <a href="http://curry.com/">http://curry.com/</a></p>
<p>Fyi: you can subscribe with:<br>iTunes (easy)<br>Juice (desiigned for the job) <a href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php">http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php</a><br>or bashpodder (quick &amp; effective linux script) <a href="http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/">http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/</a> - my favourite<br>there's many more of course.</p>
