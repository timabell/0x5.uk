I've created a wiki at [wikispaces.com](http://www.wikispaces.com/), to document things that are less transient than a blog entry.  

Take a look at [http://timwise.wikispaces.com/](http://timwise.wikispaces.com/)  

I've started adding information about the car pc, and won't make any promises about what else I'll be adding (personal motto: under promise, over deliver).  

I've made it open to all editors, and licensed under the GNU Free documentation licence to ensure the maximum value, reach and participation.
