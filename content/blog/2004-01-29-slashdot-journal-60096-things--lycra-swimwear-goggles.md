<p>Given up counting lengths. Working on technique now (think - "I like your style!"). That's not to say I've missed any sessions, in fact quite the opposite, I've been four times this week. Met up with the Triathletes on Monday, swam tues am practicing what I'd been taught, back with the triathletes wed eve (after drama tues night, first rehearsal) got more help from Mark (thnks mark, much appreciated) and could feel I was getting closer, if not faster, then usual thur am session for more practice, with some degree of success. Been at jongleurs tonight for laughs and cavorting, a good night was had by all (I think).</p>
<p>Back to town for proper session tomorrow with A and others, should be messy<nobr> </nobr>;)</p>
