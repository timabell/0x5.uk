<p>Thanks to our head of sales for this one:</p>
<p>=========================================</p>
<p>The Department of Transport has now devised a new scheme in order to identify poor drivers and give good drivers the opportunity to recognise them whilst driving.</p>
<p>For this reason as from the middle of May 2006 those drivers  who are<br>found to be driving badly which includes:</p>
<p>
    -overtaking in dangerous places;</p>
<p>
    -hovering within one inch of the car in front;</p>
<p>
    -stopping sharply;</p>
<p>
    -speeding in residential areas;</p>
<p>
    -pulling out without indication;</p>
<p>
    -performing U turns inappropriately in busy high streets;</p>
<p>
    -under taking on motorways and</p>
<p>
    -taking up more than one lane in multi lane roads,</p>
<p>
  These drivers will be issued with flags, white with a red cross,<br>signifying their inability to drive properly. These flags must be<br>clipped to a door of the car and be visible to all other drivers and<br>pedestrians.</p>
<p>Those drivers who have shown particularly poor driving skills will have<br>to display a flag on each side of the car to indicate their greater lack<br>of  skill and general lower intelligence mindset to the general public.</p>
<p>Please circulate this to as many other motorists as you can so that<br>drivers and pedestrians will be aware of the meaning of these flags.</p>
<p>
