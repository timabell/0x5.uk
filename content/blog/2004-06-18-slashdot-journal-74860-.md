<p>Just read something Ellen wrote for me years ago whilst going through some of my paper.</p>
<p>Made me think.</p>
<p>I'm really very lonely at the moment.</p>
<p>There's so many things I tried to ignore at the time, I didn't read half the things she gave me at the time because it was all a bit much, now going back is very strange.</p>
