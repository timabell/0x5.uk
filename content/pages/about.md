Hi, I'm Tim Abell (one of many, but not the
[actor](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0008543/) or the [other software
dev](https://twitter.com/timabell)).

* I build software.
* I like helping our government do [better digital things](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology).
* I like building things in smart, agile teams who don't take any shit and get
  things done.
* I also like working solo.
* I created [SQL Schema Explorer](https://timabell.github.io/schema-explorer/) and
  [ef-enum-to-lookup nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ef-enum-to-lookup).
* I'm learning to be an [entrepreneur](https://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/).

## More stuff in my world

* [Books I've been reading (goodreads)](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/50628592?shelf=read)
* I love podcasts and audiobooks, here's [my pocast subcriptions](https://timwise.co.uk/podcast-subscriptions.html).
* [Random public code and forks on github](https://github.com/timabell/)
* [Even more random gists](https://gist.github.com/timabell/)
* If we're besties you can [find me on telegram](https://t.me/tim_abell) or Signal but definitely not WhatsApp because facebook has enough data already.
