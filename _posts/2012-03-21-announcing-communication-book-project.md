It's still very rough around the edges, but if you are on a debian based system you should be able to easily get it up and running and see what you think. If you are on other platforms you'll currently need a bit (alright, a lot) of java knowledge to get this up and running.  
  
If you have the time to help I'd be very grateful. You don't have to be a coder, just letting me know if it works for you would be great.  
  
If you want to know more or would like to give it a try then please do head over to the project page at [http://launchpad.net/communication](http://launchpad.net/communication).
