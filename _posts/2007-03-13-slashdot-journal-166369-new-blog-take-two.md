<p>ok, that was an enormous failure.</p>
<p>installed wordpress on a machine at home. got hacked (duh). spent a month working my butt off at work and haven't even looked it.<br>second attempt here: <a href="http://timwise.blogspot.com/">http://timwise.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>will be full of lots of fascinating open source exploits. might even start posting pretty photos with flickr.</p>
