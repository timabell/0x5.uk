<p>Did exactly 20 lengths today in just 35 mins. then cycled all the way home to sort out this laptop.</p>
<p>Good timing on the laptop, I'd just brought it home when the system partition on my only other box just completely failed. The system then wouldn't boot at all. So I chucked in a small disk with a working 2k install as a primary master, check disk then kindly removed 70% of the files on my main system partition. Woop. Hello linux.</p>
