<p>Had two bottom wisdom teeth extracted on Tuesday and am still recovering. Don't think I'll post a pic, wouldn't want to scare the children! Thanks to my friends in reading for looking after me while I was woozy! Back to my soup now.</p>
<p>I've just booked tickets for this <a href="http://www.delicatessen-reading.org.uk/">Martyn Joseph</a>. Let me know if your gonna come too (Â£10).</p>
