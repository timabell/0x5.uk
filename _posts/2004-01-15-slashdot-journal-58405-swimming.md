<p>20 lengths today. In 45 mins. Did quite a lot in front crawl today so am quite pleased, then I used one of those float things so I could just use my legs. Apparently my kicking for front crawl adds nothing to my forwards movement but still wears me out, that might explain why I have such difficulty with front crawl. Think I'll need to work on that one. My legs seem quite good at breast stroke style swimming as I can quite easily do a length that way. I did do a couple of really fast lengths (by my standards), one in front crawl, the other in breast stroke. Oh, and just because I like being a bit sad sometimes, I counted some of the lengths in binary.<nobr> </nobr>:D</p>
