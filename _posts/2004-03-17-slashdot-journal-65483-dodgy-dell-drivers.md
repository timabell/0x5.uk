<p>Came home to find laptop with its fan on full and running at 100% cpu usage. Not good.<br>Culprit process was pctspk.<br>Found that it is related to modem drivers <a href="http://www.liutilities.com/products/wintaskspro/processlibrary/pctspk/">here</a>, and discovered this problem is <a href="http://support.packardbell.dk/pri/index.php?PibItemNr=topic_01895">known</a> to packard bell (shudder).</p>
<p>So I've dropped a support query to DELL. Wait and see time.</p>
