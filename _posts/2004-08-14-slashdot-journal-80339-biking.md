<p>Spent an enjoyable afternoon out on the trails north of henley today. Found lots of mud, nettles rocks and things interspersed with the occasional nice view and a fair amount of sunshine. A fairly injury free day given the size of our group. Tried out the new local "fat fish" shop for dinner. Tasty, would recommend, pleasant staff as well which makes such a difference when you're buying cod 'n chips!</p>
