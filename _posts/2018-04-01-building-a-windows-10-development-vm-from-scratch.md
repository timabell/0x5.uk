What a painful process! I did wonder if I could get away with mssql on linux, and tried the \[mssql docker image, which hosed my linux kernel\](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/issues/284). That's too many yaks for one morning. ## Windows Install Download from \* Windows 10 Fall Creators Update \* English \* 64-bit Start a new VM with the iso. Run the install. Install hangs on windows logo. Hard reset, try again several times. Eventually it works. Even managed to crash my host entirely. Shut down the VM with clean windows install.

\## The Snapshot Trials \[VirtualBox has a neat snapshot feature\](https://www.howtogeek.com/150258/how-to-save-time-by-using-snapshots-in-virtualbox/), so you can try out a whole tree of attempts at installs then squash them into the final image or roll them back. Take a snapshot as a starting point for trying out the eternally broken boxstarter script. ## Boxstarter \[Boxstarter script, mostly working in win 10\](https://gist.github.com/timabell/608fb680bfc920f372ac) now, but so much more to do on top that, including \[windows branch of dotfiles\](https://github.com/timabell/dotmatrix/tree/windows) (always needs work). Read the script to see what it configures and installs. You'll want to watch this vid at at least 2x playback speed: \## annoyances / setup - grab reg keys \* disable screensaver \* hide task manager when minimized \* \`HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\TaskManager\\Preferences\` - binary. sigh.settings > m \* multitasking > snap (these have been rolled in to my boxstarter, but not tested there). \* \`HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\SnapAssist\` - 0 \`HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\JointResize\` - 0 \* all sounds off - generates 100s of reg keys, one for each event \* mute ## get ready for dev \* vs sign-in \* extension updates \* ssdt - external download popup, installs sql server 2016 localdb, takes forever, requires reboot \* azure - leave for now, also external \* jetbrains toolbox (sign in) \* resharper \* datagrip ## VS Extensions \`cinst editorconfig.vs vsvim ihateregions -y\` - bit-rotten, didn't work - I should contact the \[VsVim package maintainer\](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vsvim).
