<p>yada yada</p>
<p>nothing doing today.</p>
<p>Hello James, if you see this hope the weather's nice in whichever part of the world you're in today!</p>
<p>Suppose I might as well post that my domain is timwise.co.uk, and that it currently contains a cub web site! (Which I'm v proud of. - tho you can't see most of the interesting bits because that's the admin pages.)</p>
<p>Just wondering whether to upload the code to freshmeat or summat, and if I should start using GPL 'n things.</p>
<p>Ooh, and I bought some to way radios<nobr> </nobr>:)<br>Binatone 0503, 30 quid the pair from B&amp;Q<br>(Yes I did reallly need them)</p>
<p>And a cordless drill (oops!)</p>
