title: Finding a contractor accountants

Boring but important, having an accountant firm to make sure the books are HMRC-proof is important.

I don't know why but I've found it hard to pick good ones, and harder than I expected to find, research and choose a firm.

## Things that you need to keep in mind

* Business insurance (professional indemnity etc), often bundled but needs to happen
* Accountancy software - some use their own but that makes moving firms harder, so I'd use something separate. Some accountants bundle the fee.
  * Xero - works but not very useable, seems to be built around ye-olde accountancy practices rather than what's easy to use.
  * FreeAgent - much more useable, good enough for a contracting business
* Company registration (if you're just starting), some accountants will do it for you, or you can [set a company up yourself](https://www.gov.uk/topic/company-registration-filing/starting-company)

## Things your accountants can/should do for you

* Submit yearly accounts to companies house
* Help you set tax efficient salary
* Make sure your accounts in freeagent are accurate
* Help you understand your P&L (profit and loss)
* Submit your vat returns, and help you make sure it's right
* Personal tax return prep (plus spouse), some charge extra
* Make sure you're claiming the correct expenses, notably home-office allowance
* Check your accounts are in line with current laws and tax laws.


## Additional services

Some also will do:

* Bundled FreeAgent subscription 
* Company setup
* Umbrella company stuff
* IR35 assessment/protection
* IPSE membership
* Provide a registered address to use that's not your home, and forward any mail
* Business insurance

## Contract accountant list & reviews

I've asked around my network and these are the ones I've gathered so far. I've put them in a table, added links to trustpilot reviews and made a note of current (at time of writing) review scores and counts to help decide.
