<p>About time too.</p>
<p>You can now see my complete set of browser bookmarks from my website. Pretty much updated daily.<br>Still a lot of tidying up to do as I've just shoved all my disparate bookmarks together. It's done with a bookmark synching extension for firefox, and it allows to keep all my bookmarks the same across computers / OSs profiles.</p>
<p>By the way, if you aren't already using it, then you really should give firefox a go. You'll never look back.<br><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/</a></p>
