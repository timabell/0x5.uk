title: Integrating ShipStation with QuickBooks Desktop
layout: post
---

A possible customer of my [new eCommerce Integration
business](https://ecommerceintegrations.co.uk/) popped up with an interesting
problem: how to have orders that are entered into [QuickBooks
Desktop](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/desktop/) automatically create matching
entries in [ShipStation](https://www.shipstation.com/).

> "How can I get my orders from QuickBooks into ShipStation without my staff manually retyping them?"

## What is ShipStation?

It is a one-stop order shipping interface for shipping your physical outbound
orders that can in turn talk to all the actual couriers so you don't need to
deal with them individually. It connects to Royal Mail, Hermes, DPD etc.

## Connecting ShipStation to QuickBooks Desktop

There isn't a direct way of connecting them together, so that means we need
something to do the work of pulling orders out of QuickBooks and pushing them
into ShipStation.

Here's two pieces of software that can connect the two systems together:

## Connex

* <https://www.shipstation.com/partners/connex-quickbooks/>
* <https://www.syncwithconnex.com/>
* Connex is a bit like Codeless BPA in that it enables a flow of orders, but specific to QuickBooks rather than having many connectors on both sides.
* This page lists exactly what pieces of data will be transferred: <https://help.syncwithconnex.com/hc/getting-started-with-shipstation>
* The [base price for Connex is $199/month](https://www.syncwithconnex.com/products-2/) at time of writing.

## Codeless BPA

* <https://www.codelessplatforms.com/business-process-automation-platform/>
* Codeless has a [ShipStation connector](https://www.codelessplatforms.com/connectors/shipstation-integration/)
* BPA Platform starts from Â£175/month billed annually.
* We'd need to do some investigation of the method of integrating QuickBooks Desktop with Codeless BPA.

## Connex versus Codeless

Both Codeless BPA and Connex have similar monthly costs, and both will need
setting up, so choosing which to go with is going to come down to which option
fits your businesses needs better now and in the longer term. Connex will solve
the immediate problem, but Codeless has more connections you can use in the
future.

## To integrate now, or to change technology?

As everything moves to the cloud it's worth considering whether to invest
further in your existing desktop-based technology choices, or to take the
opportunity to move to cloud based accounting and ERP systems before looking to
connect them together.
