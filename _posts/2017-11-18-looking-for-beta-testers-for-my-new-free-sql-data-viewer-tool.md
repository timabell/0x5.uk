Hi, my name's Tim and I'm a UK based developer trying to build my first startup.Â  I'm working on a data-browsing tool for Sql Server etc. that I really believe can help people do their jobs.

I'm reaching out to the online communities to try and find people who will find it useful and who are prepared to help me shape the early product.

Please take a look at my offering on [https://sqldataviewer.com/](https://sqldataviewer.com/) ... and if you like the look of it then please sign up to my [waiting list](https://www.getdrip.com/forms/70504364/submissions/new).

Thanks for your precious time!
