<p>24 lengths today, but in a slightly dismal 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Still I am getting better. Did much more front crawl today (still mostly half lengths) but did swallow/breath a fairly significant amount of chlorinated water.</p>
<p>From the 3 lengths I managed on the 2nd Dec 03, in an hour. That's much better.</p>
<p>I've been : Tue &amp; Thur 2,4,9,11,16,18,23rd Dec, Sat 3rd Jan, Tue &amp; Thur 6, 8th Jan.<br>That's.... 10 times! Yay.</p>
