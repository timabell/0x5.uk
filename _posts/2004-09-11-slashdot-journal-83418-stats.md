<p>Woo!<br>Mandrake, Apache, AWStats, wget, cron, sleepless nights...<br><nobr> </nobr>... and now I have up to date stats for <a href="http://www.timwise.co.uk/">timwise.co.uk</a>, updated automatically overnight every night for the previous day's usage. Including the cubs site.<br>See the stats link bottom right of the home page.</p>
<p>Joy.</p>
<p>Also, I've started signing into ICQ again, and there's a little image on timwise that tells you if I'm online, which is nice. I'm not too keen on the standard icq client any more, but that's ok because I use <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">GAIM</a> these days, which I can highly recommend. If you can't be bothered with that, you can click on the online img on my site and send me a message through the icq messaging centre, which is quite a cool feature.</p>
