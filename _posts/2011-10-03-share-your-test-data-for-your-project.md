Thought for the day:

  

Completed projects should **always** inlcude SQL scripts for creating working test data (i.e. so you can see the code in action).

  

I often see difficulties creating usable test data when picking up someone else's work.

  

And I'd add to that, a readme file with how to use the test data.
